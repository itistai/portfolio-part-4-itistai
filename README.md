# Examine our progress towards Sustainable Education

Based on the United Nations Sustanable Development Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

## Description

In 2015, United Nations proposed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that provided the blueprints toward - as its name - a sustainable future for everyone on Earth. All of the United Nations members were willing to achieve every goals in 2030. Now in 2023, we are half way to destination. It is a great time to review the progress we have achieved so far. However, due to the limited time, this project only focus on the goal 4 which is a great deal of concern for a person still in the academia setting as me.
